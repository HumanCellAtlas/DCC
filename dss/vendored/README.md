This directory contains vendored distributions. 

Please link each vendored distribution along with a link to the tree at the 
exact commit when the tree was copied.

Place the vendored distributions's license into LICENSE at the project root.

Try maintain the package path. If the unvendored distribution introduces the 
package `foo.bar`, the vendored package should be at `dss.vendored.foo.bar`
