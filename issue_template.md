# Bug or Feature
Pick one and start your tile with it. 

## Expected behavior
Describe the expected behavior in as much detail as possible. Assume the reader is unfamilier with this section of code. Here are some suggested details to include:
* Expected input should produce expected output.
* Expected input should not produce this unexpected output.
* Change `variableX` to `variableY` for clarity 

## Actual behavior
Describe the actual behavior in as much detail as possible. Why is it wrong if it's not obvious. Assume the read is unfamiliar with this section of code. Here are some suggested details to include:
* This incorrect input produces this output.
* This input produce this incorrect output.
* Link or locations to the relavent code that needs to be modified.

## Steps to reproduce the behavior
1. This apply more to bug than it does features.
2. Environment setup.
2. test cases to run or commands to run.
