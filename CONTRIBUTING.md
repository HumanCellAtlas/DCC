Contributions to HCA working group repos are subject to overall HCA
governance and technical guidance. In addition, contributors are
expected to abide by the following guidelines.

- Rough consensus and running code: instead of formal procedures for
  agreeing on everything, systems with working prototypes and existing
  users are prioritized as platforms for discussion.

- Keep it simple: prioritize scalability and the ability to keep the
  project easy to understand and scale over features. Use
  well-supported upstream solutions where possible. Provide useful
  defaults and don't expose unnecessary configuration options.

- Separation of concerns and layers: (TODO: elaborate)

- Don't break the build: pull requests are expected to pass all
  automated CI checks.

- Keep the build simple: Automated CI checks that are fragile or don't
  serve a clear agreed upon purpose will be removed.

- All Pull Request comments must be addressed, even after merge.

- All code must be review by at least 1 other team member.

- All Pull Request relating to an issue must include "connected to 
  #123", where #123 is the issue number.
